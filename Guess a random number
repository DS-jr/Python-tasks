# Write a program which randomly picks an integer (from 1 to 7). 
# Your program should prompt the user for guesses â€“ if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low. 
# If the user guesses correctly, the program should print how many guesses the user took to guess the right answer. 
# You can assume that the user will enter valid input.
